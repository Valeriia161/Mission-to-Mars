# ` Mission-to-Mars Challenge`


 ## `Project Overview ` <br/>
I was tasked to help Robin with her Mission to Mars web app. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. I was asked to  use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. <br/>
#### Resources
•	Data Source: [Google]( Google), [Marshemispheres]( https://marshemispheres.com/). <br/>
•	Software: Python, Jupyter, HTML, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, MongoDB, Git Bash.
